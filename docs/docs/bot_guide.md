# Create your own trading bot!

## Welcome

Interested in quantitative finance and algorithmic trading? Why not gain some hands-on experience developing a trading bot, for free! 

This is a very basic guide to create a trading bot on [Manifold Markets](https://manifold.markets/), the largest prediction market platform. 
Unlike real-money markets, which have a high barrier to entry, Manifold uses play money to predict the 
outcome of events, with a [great track record.](https://manifold.markets/calibration)
For more information about Manifold, check out [the FAQ](/faq) or [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB5TfX7eaVY&t=9s).

## Support

[Here is Manifold's official API documentation.](/faq)

To connect with the Manifold community, consider joining the [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/eHQBNBqXuh), particularly the #api-and-bots channel.
Here, you can find more information about Manifold's undocumented API, for advanced users.

## Prerequisites

Try playing around with Manifold for a while, to gain familiarity with prediction markets.

We assume you can passibly use python, and know a bit about how the web and asynchronous programming works.
We will be using the manifoldpy API wrapper, for ease of access. [Note: manifoldpy is very incomplete and being updated]

For this guide, you will need to
- Install [manifoldpy from PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/manifoldpy/) 
- Create a separate Manifold account for your bot. You will need to submit a [pull request here](https://github.com/manifoldmarkets/manifold/pulls) to gain the bot label.
- Get some mana, Manifold's play-money currency. New accounts start with 1000 free mana. 
It's not required, but to trade with more mana, consider borrowing some from another user, or be a good predictor on your human account!
