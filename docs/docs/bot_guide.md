# Create your own trading bot

## Welcome

Interested in quantitative finance? Why not gain some hands-on experience developing a trading bot! 

This is a very basic guide to create a trading bot on [Manifold Markets](https://manifold.markets/), the largest prediction market platform. 
Unlike real-money markets, which have a high barrier to entry, Manifold uses play money to predict the 
outcome of events, with a [great track record.](https://manifold.markets/calibration).
For more information about Manifold, check out [the FAQ.](/faq)

## Support

[Here is Manifold's API documentation.](/faq)

Here, you can find more information about Manifold's undocumented API.

## Prerequisites

We assume you can passibly use python, and know a bit about how the web and asynchronous programming works.

For this guide, you will need 
- Install [manifoldpy from PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/manifoldpy/) [Note: this is very incomplete]
- A separate Manifold account for your bot. You will need to submit a [pull request here](https://github.com/manifoldmarkets/manifold/pulls) to gain the bot label.
- Some mana, Manifold's play-money currenct. New accounts start with 1000 free mana. 
It's not required, but to trade with more mana, consider borrowing some from another user, or be a good predictor!
